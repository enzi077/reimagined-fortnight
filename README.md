# About

This site is an effort to help people get easy access to online links to get jobs (or apply for them). As an additional effort links to various sites for staying in paying guests and hostels have been provided for major cities within a state. The creator(s) have tried their best to keep the information intact and ensure legibility of the same. However, it is advisable once a user leaves this site for an external link they are on their own and need to exercise caution. The creator(s) are not the one in authority and won't take any blame with respect to the same for any parties involved.

# Usage

Each card represents a state or a union territory of the Republic of India. The cards in the home page display the Nominal GDP and the population of that particular state. This will give the user an idea how a particular state would fit for his job requirements. A better GDP represents the state has enough job opportunities. Clicking on a particlar card would open another page which will give user further details about the state. The details furnished include links to job sites, links to sites for paying guests and hostels and the names of important cities within the state. The cities have been handpicked by the creator(s), keeping in eye where opportunities are more.

### Created using ReactJS and Material UI

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
